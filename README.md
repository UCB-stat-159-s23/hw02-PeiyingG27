# LOSC_Event_tutorial
hw02-PeiyingG27 created by GitHub Classrooms

In this assignment, I used the LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook and companion files that are publicly available on Github. With those, I structured this repository as a reproducible research package, with installable utilities separated into a small Python package, a conda Environment specification and a new Binder link.
